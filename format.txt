Goals:
  A streamable, seekable, zoomable file

  Writing
    * can be written to in streaming manner, with no backseeking

  Reading
    * can be read in one pass with no backseeking
    * can be seeked on time-wise
    * sections can be extracted
    * can be read at varying zoom levels

  Data
    * Support multiple data types (float/double, int, bool, char)
    * support multiple aggregation types for zooming (min/max, mean, rms, all/any,
        text summary)
    * Constant or variable bitrates streams

  Library
    * Simple stream writing interface
    * Simple stream reading interface
    * Read seek interface
    * Read set-zoom-level interface

  Tools
    * Verification
    * Info


Data Streams and Summary Streams

Interleaved streams
  * Sync points

Index files

  * A documented way of generating time index files

Exploded form
  * one file per stream
